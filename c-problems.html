    <h1>PROBLEMS</h1>
    <p>Problems were numerous as they were major. <br> Many features remained broken for days as issues were resolved,<br> the inventory being a good example,<br> as the buttons seemed to crash the program.<br> The GUI, unfortunatley, had to be outright scrapped.<br> The code broke down upon commit, <br> two days were spent on trying to fix the errors,<br> but the descision was made to scrap it 2 hours before release.
